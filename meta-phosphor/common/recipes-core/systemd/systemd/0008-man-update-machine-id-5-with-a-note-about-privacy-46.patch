+    <para>This ID uniquely identifies the host. It should be considered "confidential", and must not
+    be exposed in untrusted environments, in particular on the network. If a stable unique
+    identifier that is tied to the machine is needed for some application, the machine ID or any
+    part of it must not be used directly. Instead the machine ID should be hashed with a
+    cryptographic, keyed hash function, using a fixed, application-specific key. That way the ID
+    will be properly unique, and derived in a constant way from the machine ID but there will be no
+    way to retrieve the original machine ID from the application-specific one.</para>
